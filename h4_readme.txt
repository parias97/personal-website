Compared to the HW2 version of my website, I've made my website mobile-friendly. In my HW2 version, my elements
would overlap when viewed on a smaller display, but that's not the case in the new version, thanks to Bootstrap.
I've changed the overall structure. Instead of using a side nav to house the links to my homework assignments, 
I use Cards, a class that Bootstrap offers, that link to the homework assignments. I'm using the standard 
Bootstrap navbar, which includes my logo and social links similar to my HW2 top header.
